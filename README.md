  # 🔧 SmartPredict – Predictive Maintenance on IBM Cloud

## 🔍 Project Overview

**SmartPredict** is a machine learning solution designed to predict industrial machinery failures before they happen. By analyzing sensor data, it helps industries cut down on unexpected breakdowns and improve their maintenance strategies. The entire workflow — from data analysis to model deployment — is built using Python and hosted on **IBM Cloud Lite**, leveraging tools like Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning.
